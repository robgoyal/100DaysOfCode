# 100 Days of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 6, 2016

<b> Thoughts: </b> Wasn't the most productive day with work and slacking off with league but at least at I committed to logging my progress today and I still coded for 1 hour following the LearnCodetheHardWay tutorial (something I tried to avoid). Will strive for a better day tomorrow.

<b> Today's Progress: </b> I learned on how to pass arguments to a Python script which was neat and something I was working towards.
