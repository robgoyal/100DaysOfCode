# 100 Days of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 6, 2016

<b> Thoughts: </b> Wasn't the most productive day with work and slacking off with league but at least at I committed to logging my progress today and I still coded for 1 hour following the LearnCodetheHardWay tutorial (something I tried to avoid). Will strive for a better day tomorrow.

<b> Today's Progress: </b> I learned on how to pass arguments to a Python script which was neat and something I was working towards.

### Day 1: July 7, 2016

<b> Thoughts: </b> A more productive day which I could've done better but feeling better about where I'm heading towards. 

<b> Today's Progress: </b> Finished about 6 more chapters on LPTHW and was able to write the initial draft of the Python Initializer script. Just need to add code for Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, Matlab, and maybe more.

### Day 2: July 8, 2016

<b> Thoughts: </b> Slowly getting towards a better stream of productivity, still not what I want but slowly working towards it which is something I feel better about. 

<b> Today's Progress: </b> Finished about 4-5 exercises on LPTHW and listened to 8 chapters of You Are A Badass.
