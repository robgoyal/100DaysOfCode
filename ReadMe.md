# 100 Days of Code

## Purpose / Motivation

Previously, the goal of this repo was to track my journey of code for 100 days. But I'm going to use it to store my Technical Project goals as well as my Reading Goals. 

I'll keep a log of my day to day activities in terms of what coding assignments, projects, online courses or books I read each day. I'll complete a minimum of 1 hour of code a day for at least 100 days. Hopefully, this will put me on the right track to become a better programmer.
