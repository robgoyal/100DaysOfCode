# 100 Days of Code

### Purpose / Motivation

The goal with the 100 Days of Code movement is to code a minimum of one hour each day for 100 days. This repository will be used to document my self-learning programming goal for the next 100 days and log my progress into DayLogs. 

I'll talk about the progress, thoughts on what I learned and how I am progressing, projects that I worked on, books I read, etc. 

I'll spend more than 3-4 hours working on code some of the days depending on how much time I have and some of the days I'll spend less time but no matter what, I will spend at least an hour writing some code that is not part of a tutorial or other resources.
